# Getting Started

### Docker:

First things first, install Docker for your operating system. Instructions for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) are readily available available.

### Docker Compose:

Next, open a command line shell, switch to the main project directory and run `docker-compose up`. This will start up all the backing services required for the code to run. These are defined in the [docker-compose.yml](../src/docker-compose.yml) file.

Additional details regarding docker-compose can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Run Application:

There are numerous tutorials on how to run to .NET applications if you're new to the ecosystem. However, the basic steps below.

- Install and start [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)
- Open the solution file [GOOM.ERC.CorrelationIds.sln](../src/GOOM.ERC.CorrelationIds.sln) in Visual Studio
- Run all the API and Background projects
